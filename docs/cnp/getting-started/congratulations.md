# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of CNP** and **created** your first project using CNP.

CNP has **much more to offer**!

Have **5 more minutes**? Start creating **[your own template](../templates/create-template)**.

Anything **unclear** or **buggy** in this tutorial? [Please report it!](https://github.com/0xMRTT/0xMRTT.github.io/issues)

## What's next?

- Search a template on [CNP search](../templates/search)
- Get involved in the [CNP Community](../community/contribute)
